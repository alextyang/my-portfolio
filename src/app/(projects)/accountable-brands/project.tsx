                    The passion and comprehensiveness of online activism in 2020 was outstanding. Without a central authority behind the flood of educational content, it us a powerful testament to many&apos;s desire to learn, share, and do the right thing.

                <P>
                    I drew from the visual language of social media activism, fact sheets / nutrition facts, and NGOs to create a urgent, adaptable, and concise visual language.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Structurally, there are two main components:
                    <ul><b>A brand</b> - The consumer-facing identity of an organization.</ul>
                    <ul><b>A report</b> - A distinct event or pattern of misconduct.</ul>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This raised the question of scope. What counts as misconduct? What scale of misbehavior is relevant? What about words without action?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I surveyed headlines and activist resources to try to find the common qualities of misconduct and found three themes: <b>human rights abuse, political abuse, and anti-consumer practices</b>. I liked these themes because they are emotionally resonant and issue-encompassing by consequence.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span className="opacity-60">Example: Oil company lies about climate change. Instead of arguing a political stance, this category system would emphasize the measurable consequences of this action: misinformed consumers.</span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This structure intentionally excludes: individual people, controversial statements / marketing, and all &apos;socially-conscious&apos; PR strategies (e.g. donations, pledges, mission statements).

                    A platform that relies so much user content needs an extremely scalable and feature-rich backend that can support abuse detection, moderation, version-control, user authorization, and complex parsing functions. Luckily, MediaWiki (the software that powers Wikipedia) is open-source, well-documented, and can do all this and more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    However, building an adapted front-end inside of MediaWiki would be unnecessarily complicated. Instead, I decided to learn React + Next.js to build a front-end server specifically to support the Accountable Brand structure, pulling content from the MediaWiki network and (potentially) beyond.

                    This was the largest project I&apos;ve ever completed. Learning both front and backend development all at once was challenging and rewarding. While I have worked my way up most of the learning curves, there is still plenty to rework and optimize.

                        Currently, editing and moderation is restricted to the native MediaWiki interface, because of it&apos;s rich and documented feature-set.

                <P>
                    This project has taken me from idea to design, to prototype, to service. It took around 3 months to complete, and in that time I was completely immersed in the interdisciplinary process of building digital solutions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        I made strategic product decisions based on social-impact goals, user needs, and technical constraints.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I deeply and rapidly developed my front-end skill set, learning React + Next.js and component-based interfaces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I honed my visual design capability, crafting a cohesive and adaptable brand identity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I learned how to manage a complex, multi-component project, from design to deployment over a tight timeline.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I put this project on pause to search for a job, but I can&apos;t wait to continue prepping the brand for release as soon as I can support it. Thanks for reading!
